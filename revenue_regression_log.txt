PROMPT:

The user would like to complete the following computational task(s):

I would like to pull quarterly data on U.S. GDP, consumer confidence, and consumer discretionary spending from 2010 Q1 to 2022 Q2. I would then like to run a linear regression with these variables as the independent variables and my company’s quarterly revenue for the same time period as the dependent variable. I would like this regression to also account for seasonality.

Data used for regression is in the variable df, a Pandas DataFrame. Returns a dictionary where each key is  the name of an independent variable and each value is the associated coefficient.   statlib
5           lin_reg_seas  dep_var, ind_vars, date_var, seas_per, df  Runs a least squares linear regression of variable specified by dep_var (a string) against variables specified by ind_vars (a list of strings). The regression will also account for seasonality by adding indicator variables for each month (if seas_per = "monthly") or quarter (if seas_per = "quarterly") whose values are determined based on the date values in date_var. Data used for the regression (including both the independent variables and the dependent variables) is in variable df, a Pandas Dataframe. Returns a dictionary where each key is  the name of an independent variable and each value is the associated coefficient.   statlib

RESPONSE:

Here is some code that should accomplish the computational task the user specified using the functions listed:

```
import econdata
import statlib
import pandas as pd

# Pull data on U.S. GDP, consumer confidence, and consumer discretionary spending
start_quarter = '2010Q1'
end_quarter = '2022Q2'
gdp_data = econdata.us_gdp(start_quarter, end_quarter)
cons_spending_data = econdata.us_cons_disc_spending(start_quarter, end_quarter)
cons_conf_data = econdata.us_cons_conf(start_quarter, end_quarter)

# Merge the data into a single dataframe
merged_data = pd.merge(gdp_data, cons_spending_data, on='date')
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, cons_conf_data, on='date')

# Pull data on company's quarterly revenue
revenue_data = pd.read_csv('company_revenue_data.csv')

# Merge the revenue data into the merged_data dataframe
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, revenue_data, on='date')

# Run a linear regression with seasonality
dep_var = 'revenue'
ind_vars = ['gdp', 'cons_spending', 'cons_conf']
date_var = 'date'
seas_per = 'quarterly'
df = merged_data
coefficients = statlib.lin_reg_seas(dep_var, ind_vars, date_var, seas_per, df)

# Print the coefficients
print(coefficients)
```

Note that this assumes that the company's quarterly revenue data is stored in a CSV file called "company_revenue_data.csv" in the same directory as the script. If the data is stored elsewhere, you will need to modify the `pd.read_csv()` call accordingly.
